     * the right. Special cases for the radius make Create turn

     * Create from accurately carrying out some drive commands.
     * For example, it may not be possible for Create to drive at
     * full speed in an arc with a large radius of curvature.
     *
     * Special cases:
     *  - Straight                        = 32768 or 32767
     *  - Turn in place clockwise         = 65535

     *                   Radius in millimeters at which Create will
     *                   turn. The longer radii make Create drive
